Each workout includes:
- Clear time domains
- Specific loading
- Scaling options
- Movement patterns that complement each other
- Varied energy systems

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific scaling progressions?
2. Create beginner versions of these workouts?
3. Design sport-specific variations?
4. Add mobility prep work for each workout?
