I'll help organize movement alternatives with their progressions from easier to more challenging.

**Walk/Run Pattern Movements (Ascending Difficulty)**
1. Walking
2. Lunges
3. Running at steady pace
4. Jumping lunges
5. Broad jumping lunges 
6. Sprinting

**Jump Pattern Movements (Ascending Difficulty)**
1. Air squat
2. Single unders
3. Jumping squat 
4. Single jumps
5. Broad jumps
6. Double unders

**Push Pattern Movements (Ascending Difficulty)**
1. Shoulder tap
2. Push-up with knees

6. Handstand walk

**Pull Pattern Movements (Ascending Difficulty)**
1. Ring rows
2. Negative pull-ups
3. Banded pull-ups
4. Strict pull-ups

2. Regular burpee
3. Chest-to-ground burpee

Each movement pattern builds on the previous level, allowing athletes to:
- Progress systematically
- Scale appropriately to their fitness level
- Build proper movement patterns
- Maintain intensity while scaling difficulty

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific weight recommendations?
2. Include detailed movement standards?
3. Suggest workout combinations using these alternatives?
4. Create sample scaled workouts?
